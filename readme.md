# Java Intro Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is the tasteful interaction between objects to achieve a common goal.  In a proper object oriented solution
all the objects share the same level of responsiblity (weight).  All the objects 

# Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymoripshm
- Inheritance
- Composition

#### Abstraction
To abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something – sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. So when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing.
- Keywords/concepts:
  - `class`
  - `interface`
  - `abstract`
  - Methods/functions

#### Encapsulation
The definition of encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule". Removing access to parts of your code and making things private is exactly what Encapsulation is all about (often times, people refer to it as data hiding).
- Keywords
  - `public`
  - `protected`
  - `private`

#### Inheritance
Inheritance lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. In JavaScript this is done by Prototypal Inheritance.
- Keywords
  - `extends`

#### Polymoripshm
Polymorphism means "the condition of occurring in several different forms." That's exactly what the fourth and final pillar is concerned with – types in the same inheritance chains being able to do different things.
- Keywords
  - @Override 
  - `abstract`
